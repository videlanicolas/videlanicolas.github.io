## About Me

Welcome to my personal page!

This is a simple, minimalistic, dark-themed Jekyll site. I'm using this to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences.

Feel free to explore the **Blog** section for articles and the **Projects** section to see what I've been working on.

You can find more about my professional background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.linkedin_username }}) and my code repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).

*(Social media links can be configured in _config.yml)*
